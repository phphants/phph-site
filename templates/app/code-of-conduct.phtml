    <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meetings are required to agree with the following code
    of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout all events. We are expecting cooperation from all
    participants to help ensure a safe, inclusive environment for everybody.</p>

    <p><strong><em>We operate a zero-tolerance policy on harassment. Keep it friendly.</em></strong></p>

    <p>Additionally, we expect you to:</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Behave professionally.</li>
            <li>Be respectful to others.</li>
            <li>Not insult or put down others experience or ability.</li>
            <li>Share and be nice.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Need Help?</h2>
    <p>You can contact the organisers at <a href="mailto:info@phphants.co.uk">info@phphants.co.uk</a>, send a direct message to <a href="https://twitter.com/phphants" >@phphants</a> on twitter or speak to an organiser, in person, at an event.</p>
    <p>The list of current organisers and how to contact them is available on the <a href="<?php echo $this->url('team'); ?>">team page</a>.</p>
    <p>If you have a complaint that involves an organiser, you can contact one of the others in confidence. The group is the priority and steps will be taken to ensure the group is successful.</p>
    <p>PHP Hampshire is part of a larger community of PHP User Groups, around the world. If you feel your complaint requires external arbitration, let one of the organisers know and we can discuss the issue with the organisers of those User Groups.</p>

    <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
    <p>Our user group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age,
    sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).
    We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
    appropriate for any venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media.
    Community members violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the
    organisers.</p>

    <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
    <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
    appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
    harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
    and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>
    <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised
    images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
    clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>
    <p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organisers may take any action they deem
    appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community with no refund.</p>
    <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact
    an organiser immediately.</p>
    <p>The organisers will be happy to help participants in contacting the local police constabulary,
    provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of any events.
    We value your attendance.</p>
    <p>We expect community participants to follow these rules at all times, including at meetups, conferences,
    workshops, via our online communities (Twitter, Facebook, Google Groups, GitHub, IRC, etc.) and any related socials.</p>
