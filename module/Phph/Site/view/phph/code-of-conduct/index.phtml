    <p>PHP Hampshire is a community driven PHP User Group, run by volunteers. It is for anyone wishing to learn PHP and related technologies, share knowledge and promote the PHP community in Hampshire.</p>
    <p>To achieve this, PHP Hampshire provide communication channels such as a <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/phphants" >Google Group</a>, <a href="https://github.com/phphants" >Github organisation</a>, IRC channel, <a href="https://twitter.com/phph" >Twitter account</a>, monthly meetups and social events.</p>
    <p>Communication can be informal and chatty but should be appropriate for a professional audience.  These channels are open to everyone, regardless of education, experience, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion.</p>
    <p>No one is to be excluded nor made to feel they are excluded.</p>

    <p>PHP Hampshire is part of a larger community of PHP User Groups, around the world. If you feel your complaint requires external arbitration, let one of the organisers know and we can discuss the issue with the organisers of those User Groups.</p>
